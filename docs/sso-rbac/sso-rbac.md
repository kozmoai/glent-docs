## Role-based access control

Glint provides a high granularity RBAC mechanism, allowing you to fully control who sees, modifies, creates and deletes data and resources within the software catalog, and in actions that are exposed using the software catalog.

For more information on Glint's RBAC capabilities check out the following resources:

- [Roles, teams & ownership in Glint](rbac/rbac.md)
- [Software catalog RBAC](../build-your-software-catalog/set-catalog-rbac/set-catalog-rbac.md)

## Single sign-on

Glint integrates with all major SSO providers, allowing you to seamlessly import users, and teams, and also exposing Glint to your organization in a managed manner.

By integrating an SSO with Glint, you can utilize existing teams to assign permissions to users inside the software catalog.

To learn more about Glint's SSO integrations and integrate the SSO provider you use with your Glint, check out the [SSO](./sso-providers/sso-providers.md) page.
