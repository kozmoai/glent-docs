To install the integration, you need a Kubernetes cluster that the integration's container chart will be deployed to.

Please make sure that you have [`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl) and [`helm`](https://helm.sh/) installed on your machine, and that your `kubectl` CLI is connected to the Kubernetes cluster where you plan to install the integration.
