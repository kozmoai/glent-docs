# Bitbucket Exporter

Our integration with Bitbucket allows you to export Bitbucket objects to Glint as entities of existing blueprints. The integration supports real-time event processing so Glint always provides an accurate **real-time** representation of your Bitbucket resources.

## What does our Bitbucket Exporter offer you?

- List and export existing Bitbucket objects from your Bitbucket organization;
- Watch for Bitbucket objects changes (create/update/delete) in real-time, and automatically apply the changes to your Entities in Glint;
- Configure which Bitbucket objects are relevant, and how to map and transform objects to Glint Entities.

## Next Steps

- [Install Glint's Bitbucket Exporter](./installation.md)
