By using Glint's CI/CD integrations you can always keep your software catalog up to date by making updates directly from your CI/CD.

In addition, you can use Glint as a source-of-truth and use values saved in Glint for configurations, variables and other programmatic resources for your CI/CD pipelines as they are running.
